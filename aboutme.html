<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>My name is Christopher Santiago and I am a high school senior. After high school, I want to become a professional video editor. My favorite animals are dogs because they are very friendly and energetic. Cats are also cool but cats sometimes acts like humans. My favorite  food is tacos because the Ingredients mixes very well together and makes the food really delicious. </p>
