  <h1> Santa </h1>
  <a href = "ddlab3.html"> This goes back to the home page </a>
<p>Santa is a legendary character originating in Eastern Christian culture who is said to bring children gifts on Christmas Eve of toys and candy or coal or nothing, depending on whether they are "naughty or nice". He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his workshop at the North Pole, and flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air. </p>
